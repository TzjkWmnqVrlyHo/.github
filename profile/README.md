A Deep Dive into the Plot:

"Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3" follows Ruhaan, a self-proclaimed ghostbuster, who gets embroiled in the supernatural conflicts of a haunted Kolkata mansion.

The narrative introduces fresh elements, such as the complex characterization of Debendranath's spirit and the intricate conspiracy between the sisters, Manjulika and Anjulika. However, the film's reliance on previously established humor and plot points is a significant aspect of the criticism.

Conclusion:

The film's appeal lies primarily in its entertainment value and the established presence of its stars.
